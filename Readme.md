# Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

> In this project which is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program, I built a neural network using only Numpy to carry out a prediction problem on bike sharing patterns prediction. This project implements forward and back propagation.

# Setup

1. Create a new conda environment


`conda create --name deep-learning python=3`


2. Activate the environment

`conda activate deep-learning`


3. Install dependencies

`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

4. Download or clone this predicting-bikesharing repository.

`git clone git@github.com:karemsaamba/project-bikesharing.git`



# Usage

1. Open up the notebook server 

`jupyter notebook`

2. Open the notebook and run code cells inside. 

`Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb`

<em>The server is located in: `localhost:8888`</em>
